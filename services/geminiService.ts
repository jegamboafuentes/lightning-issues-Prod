    Please analyze this repository deeply acting as a Senior Staff Engineer.
    1. Use Google Search to understand what this repository does, its main technologies, architecture, and recent activity.
    2. Search specifically for "issues site:github.com/${repoInfo.owner}/${repoInfo.name}" to see existing problems and avoid duplicates.
    ${scanTodos ? '3. Search for TODO/FIXME comments in the code as requested.' : '3. Suggest 3 distinct, non-trivial, and highly specific issues.'}

    "${combinedPerspective}"
    
    CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR DIVERSITY:
    - Do NOT suggest generic "Update README" or "Add CI" issues unless the repo is completely empty or you are specifically focusing on Community Health.
    - Look for *specific* technical improvements based on the language (e.g., if React, suggest Hooks optimization; if Python, suggest typing improvements).
    - If you cannot find deep code details via search, infer likely technical debt based on the project age and tech stack.
    - Make the issues sound like they were written by a developer who has read the code.

    ${specificInstructions}

    For each suggestion, provide:
    - A clear, professional Title.
    - A very detailed Body in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Include headers, code blocks where relevant, and a 'Tasks' list.
    - The type of issue. Choose from: Bug, Feature, Refactor, Documentation, Security, Performance, Accessibility, Testing, Chore, Design.
    - A short reasoning explaining why this is valuable.

    CRITICAL FALLBACK:
    If Google Search returns NO information (e.g. the repo is new, empty, or not indexed), DO NOT refuse to answer. 
    Instead, generate 3 generic, high-quality "best practice" issue suggestions that would apply to almost any open-source project, but TRY to tailor them to the likely language/tech stack if you can infer it.
    
    IMPORTANT OUTPUT FORMAT:
    You must return a valid JSON array.
    Do not wrap the JSON in markdown code blocks.
    Start the response with '[' and end with ']'.
    Do not include any conversational text like "I attempted to analyze..." or "Here are the suggestions".

    Example:
    [
      {
        "title": "Refactor [ComponentName] to use Composition Pattern",
        "body": "Detailed description...",
        "type": "Refactor",
        "reasoning": "Reduces complexity..."
      }
    ]

      }
    });

    const text = response.text;
    if (!text) {
      throw new Error("No data received from AI");
    }

    // Robust JSON extraction
    let jsonStr = text.trim();
    
    // 1. Try to find the JSON array if there is extra text around it
    const jsonMatch = jsonStr.match(/\[[\s\S]*\]/);
    if (jsonMatch) {
      jsonStr = jsonMatch[0];
    } else {
      // If we can't find a JSON array block, and the text doesn't start with [, it's likely a conversational error.
      if (!jsonStr.startsWith('[')) {
        console.warn("AI returned non-JSON response:", text);
        // We throw a specific error so the UI can handle it or the user knows why.
        throw new Error("The AI provided a text response instead of specific issues. This usually happens for new or unindexed repositories. Please try again.");
      }
    }

    // 2. Clean up any markdown code blocks that might still be present
